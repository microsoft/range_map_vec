  # There are types where it makes sense to define the length, but it can never
  # be empty. This lint is reasonable for container-like data-structures, but
  # makes less sense for hardware-backed data structures.
  "-Aclippy::len_without_is_empty",
  # While it's generally a good idea to derive / implement `Default` when
  # appropriate, there are many types in the HvLite codebase where a type has a
  # `new()` method, but no sensible "Default".
  "-Aclippy::new_without_default",
  # This is the #1 most commonly ignored lint for a reason (at least according
  # to [this famous issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/5418)
  # on the clippy GitHub repo)! There are plenty of perfectly reasonable
  # functions that require a large number of non-optional arguments,
  # particularly when working with low-level hardware APIs.
  "-Aclippy::too_many_arguments",
  # This is a heuristic based lint that isn't always appropriate. While it's
  # often a good to decompose complex types into more digestible chunks, there
  # are many cases where a one-off complex type is required, and suppressing
  # this lint will simply add line-noise.
  "-Aclippy::type_complexity",
  # This lint attempts to simplify usages of if let usage in a loop where only
  # one variant type is used. While somewhat useful, its suggestions can lead to
  # throwing away potentially useful error information in non-obvious ways.
  "-Aclippy::manual_flatten",
  # This lint warns about comparing boolean values in an `assert_eq!` statement when `assert!`
  # could be used instead. While shorter, the explicit comparison can be more obvious to read
  # in certain cases than unary operators with `assert!`.
  "-Aclippy::bool_assert_comparison",
  # This lint suggests collapsing Box::new(Foo::default()) into Box::default(). We often
  # prefer to specify types completely for local code clarity's sake.
  "-Aclippy::box_default",
  # This lint is purely style, and we are ok with inlined and uninlined format args.
